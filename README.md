Angular-Countdown-Timer
=======================

Project built in Angular.js, with Karma-Jasmine and Selenium tests
<br>
This repo should include all the necessary Node modules, but run an NPM install just in case.
<br>
In order to run Jasming tests, just run command : "karma start karma.conf.js" , in <b><u>static</u></b> directory.
<br>
I would like to thank the folks at DataRobot for giving me the opportunity to build this code exercise. I thought it was very cool, it was an eye opener. Now I understand why Angular is becoming so popular, it was extremely easy to test the code. I am obviously going to have this tool under my belt in the near future.

I complete the requested tasks, and still have an additional day, but I am going to be running around all day tomorrow, but this has covered all your requests, even the bonuses. I did not get too crazy with Directives.
